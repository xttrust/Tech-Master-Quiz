## Design Choices

### Fonts

While choosing the fonts for website I have searched on Google for the best fonts to use in 2023. And so I've integrated [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/ "Google Fonts") to find a typeface that complements the website's aesthetic. For the main text, I've opted for [Montserrat](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Montserrat?query=mon "Montserrat font"). To distinguesh the headers from the rest of the font I have selected [Roboto](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto?query=mon "Roboto font")

### Icons

As for icons I decided to use for my website [Font Awesome library](https://fontawesome.com/ "Font Awesome").

### Colors

When I selected the colors for the website I had in mind tech and colorfull. So I went on pinterest.com and searched for colorfull projects. I've have selected an image from there. After that, using a collor picker I have manualy created a new set of collors using [Colorcombos](https://www.colorcombos.com/combomaker.html?design=cupcakes&output_width=100&size_option=element&colors=B86AD9,383E6E,1E2140,3D9DF2,F2E0BD,F00909,09E73E,FFFFFF&background_color=FFFFFF&show_hex_flag=Y "colorcombos")

I will explain the uses of the various colors below, starting from top to bottom.

![Colors Pallet](wireframes/colors.png)

- clr-pink: #b86ad9 - This color will be used for buttons, links, borders, headers and hovers.
- clr-primary: #383e6e - This color will be used for section backgrounds and for body background pallete
- clr-dark: #1e2140 - This collor will be used for body background pallete
- clr-blue: #3d9df2 - This collor will be used for buttons and links
- clr-tan: #f2e0bd - This color will be used for links in the footer and for icons
- clr-red: #f00909 - This color will be used to display the wrong answers
- clr-green: #09e73e - This color will be used to display the correct answers
- clr-white: #ffffff - This color will be used for text

### Structure

The website will follow a mobile-first strategy, the main target is to create a visually appealing design for smaller screens. As for the smallest design I chose Samsung Galaxy S8 and iPhone 5. Target resolution is 320px. To ensure responsiveness, I'll rely on the predefined screen size breakpoints provided by [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/layout/breakpoints/ "Bootstrap").

| Screen Size | Breakpoint |
| ----------- | ---------- |
| x-small     | <576px     |
| small       | => 576px   |
| medium      | => 768px   |
| large       | => 992px   |
| x-large     | => 1200px  |
